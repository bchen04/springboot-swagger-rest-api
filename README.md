# Sample Spring Boot (2.3.1) RESTful API with Swagger (OpenAPI 3)

## Motivation

While searching through GitHub for some boilerplate code on how to setup a Spring Boot project with Swagger-UI enabled, I find it quite difficult to find a working example, at least one that was still relevant and up to date. Anyways, I thought Iâ€™d create my own and share with everyone. This is for anyone that needs some quick boilerplate code to setup their new API project.
